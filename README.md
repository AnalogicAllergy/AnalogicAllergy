### Hi there 👋

I'm a Brazil based developer in a amazing journey to become a Data Scientist in 2021. I mainly code in Python, but also know my way around Javascript (Node.js, React and React Native) and Dart (for my Flutter based projects). I'm currently working on data science solution that aims to predict store sales in 6 weeks in advance.

```javascript
const analogicallergy = {
  code: [Python, Dart, Javascript],
  focus: [ Data Science, Machine Learning, Flutter],
  challenge: "Become a Data Scientist in 2021"
}
```

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Sales Prediction solution based on historic sales data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Flutter
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Data Science and Flutter projects
